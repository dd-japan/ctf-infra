## What's this
This repository contains guides and configuration files of CTFd server, which is able to host on Google Cloud Run.


## Datadog Employees
If you are using Datadog Sandbox project, we have guard rails.
As a workaround, add a tag that adapts to the guardrail's exclusion rules: `external-access:allowed` in the case of Cloud Run
